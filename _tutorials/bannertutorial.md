# Making Banners
You can make banners using the [Banner Editor](https://bannerlord.party/banner/) made by reddit user [BizzFarts](https://www.reddit.com/user/bizzfarts/).
The given code can be used as an entry for the common tag *'banner_key'*, an example of this is seen in the SandBox\spclan.xml. Also, you can post and discuss banner designs on [r/BannerlordBanners](https://www.reddit.com/r/BannerlordBanners/).
